# mpc-local-planner-matlab-version-using-casadi
The overall aim of this project, was to develop an MPC controller for Donkey Car robot to avoid objects while it is operating inside a specific 2D environment. A Donkey Car robot was provided with Raspberry Pi 4 control unit running Raspbian Operating System. On the other hand, MATLAB support package for R-Pi was used to create connection between MATLAB and R-Pi. CasADi library was used in order to implement MPC controller in MATLAB with pre-defined constraints on control actions and also pre-defined objects inside the operation environment. Finally, a comprehensive algorithm was generated to control the actual robot from MATLAB simulation while avoiding static obstacles.
